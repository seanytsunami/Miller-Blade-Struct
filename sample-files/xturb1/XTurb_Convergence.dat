   This file lists any convergence issues during the solution process.
   Problems are listed BELOW corresponding case number.

   BEMT :  If NOTHING is listed below a case number, then NO problems
           were found.

   HVM  :  Lists convergence of CP and/or GAM and will say whether or
           not convergence was achieved.
